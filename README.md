# EvaraShop E-Commerce

A frontend e-commerce project built to master advanced CSS layouts and JavaScript logic.

## 🛠 Key Features
* Dynamic Product Display.
* Functional Shopping Cart (Add/Remove logic).
* Fully responsive navigation and grid system.

## 🧠 Why I built this
This project was a deep dive into **JavaScript logic**. I focused on:
* Handling arrays of product data.
* Writing clean, reusable functions.
* Building a real-world UI from scratch.

*Note: This is a frontend-only project focused on UI/UX and JS logic.*
